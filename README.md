# Plenty More Fish in the Sea

## Created for <a href="https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2022">Game Off 2022</a>
Plenty More Fish in the Sea is a 3D platformer inspired by the Sonic Adventure games, and created for Game Off 2022's theme of "Cliché".

Our team initially spitballed ideas, and eventually settled on wanting to make something using the cliché of an anime character running to school while holding toast in their mouth. After bouncing ideas off each other we eventually realised that a lot of cliché idioms referenced fish - plenty more fish in the sea, a fish out of water, getting off the hook, shooting fish in a barrel etc., so we elected to have every character in our game be... fish! (It makes complete sense trust me)

## Gameplay
As mentioned, the intention was to get something which felt roughly like the Sonic Adventure games, a fast paced 3D platformer where you can take advantage of physics to get around the levels in interesting ways, allowing sections to be skipped entirely with creative use of ramps and high speeds. We'd recommend you have a play around with the game and see how you can break it in various (hopefully somewhat intended) ways!

There are a variety of movement options to maintain speed, for example while moving around corners you might choose to dive as this provides much twitchier rotation, but you won't be able to build speed while doing so and this will want to run when on a straight, or you might choose to use a homing attack to cancel your momentum if you're moving quickly over a long jump and need to land precisely.
